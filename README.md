# Zurb Foundation Offcanvas top-bottom behaviour

I have added directly to foundation offcanvas js and scss core files the top and bottom behaviour,
which include push, overlap and sub-menu 

[Demo here](http://tsalah_prototypes.llrdev.org.uk/offcanvas-top)

## How to use it

	you can simply copy and paste the code from 
		bower_components/foundation/js/foundation/foundation.offcanvas.js
		bower_components/foundation/scss/foundation/components/_offcanvas.scss
	to your foundation copy and start using top bottom behaviour exactly as you would for left and right offcanvas

	for example to use top offcanvas 
	use the class top-off-canvas-menu and top-off-canvas-toggle

	BUT KEEP IN MIND.
	I have modified the core files in purpose to offer a pull request to zurb foundation.
	So if you replace those files with my code and you update your zurb foundation this code will be lost.
	You will have to replace it again.

## Hope this will help and don't hesitate to leave comments, critics or ideas.
